# Gateway

## Technological

### Components
* Network-compatible microcontroller
    * RaspberryPi

    
### Functionality
The gateway is used to link the UUIDs with the corresponding RDF-schema. For that matter all the single sensor-boards are connected to the gateway with a USB-cable at the beginning. If the sensor-board is in setup mode, it is listed in the web interface to start the initialization afterwards.

**Initialization:**
At the beginning of the initialization it will be checked, if the connected sensor-board has a UUID. If not, the UUID will be generated by the gateway and transferred to the sensor-board. After that the RDF-schema is requested by the sensor-board, linked to the UUID and saved on the gateway. The gateway is transferring the valid bridge-configuration to the connected sensor-board afterwards.

**Data transfer**
The bridge is requesting the linked RDF-schema of the UUID at the gateway continuously.
