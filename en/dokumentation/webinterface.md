The web interface consists of two parts, the **device** and the **radio** .


### Device
If there are no devices (sensor boards) connected, you will get to see the following window:

By clicking on the button _Show Device_ all [approved devices] will be listed.  

Each **device** is listed with the following information: 

* ID
* Manufacturer
* ProductID
* VendorID
* LocationID
* â€¦

You can get the information of each single **device** to check which type of sensor it is.

Furthermore the _UUID_ is assigned when checking the information, if there is none existing.

Generating the _UUID_ is marked with a flash message.

The existing **radio module** config is selected in the next stept, which will be sent to the board. After pressing the button _Initialize_, the board is saving the configuration.
